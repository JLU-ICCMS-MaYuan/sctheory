This directory contains input files for DOS calculations.

cldat   - remove output files
cu.parm - TB parameters for Cu
*.vec   - kmeshes generated by means of GTPack

Calculation of  bandstructures:
------------------------------

bg_20096.in     - bnds from 20096 k-vectors for GAUSS
bg_2304.in      - bands from 2304 k-vektors for GAUSS
bt_tetra.in     - band structure with TETRA for total DOS
btp_tetra.in    - band structure with TETRA for total and partial DOS

Calculation of DOS:
------------------:
dg_20096.in     - DOS with GAUSS and 20096 k-vectors (total DOS only)
dg_2304.in      - DOS with GAUSS and 2304  k-vectors (total DOS only)
dtg_tetra.in    - DOS with GAUSS, but k-mesh from b_tetra.in (total DOS only)
dt_tetra.in     - DOS with TETRA, but total DOS only
dtp_tetra.in    - DOS with TETRA, but total and partial densities of states
