BCS
MODEL
The
treatment
of
the
problem
is
based
on
the
BCS
model,
1
generalized
to
the
case
of
multiple
bands
crossing
the
Fermi
level,
each
of
them
assigned
a
dif
ferent
value
of
the
ener
gy
gap.
Such
an
extension
of
the
BCS
model
was
proposed
by
Suhl,
Matthias,
and
W
alker
.
32
Its
application
is
necessary
for
MgB
2
due
to
the
Fermi
surface
structure.
Moreover
,
i
n
the
case
of
the
ultrathin
lm,
every
band
additionally
splits
into
two-dimensional
subbands
reecting
the
electron
conne-
ment.
Let
us
denote
the
band
indices
by




including
the
band
type
as

as
the

For

broken

the

for

which
requires

The

are
conned
in
a

in

Usu-
ally
the

square
well
model
is
used
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
actual

is
of

The

may
equal
the

of

that
the

this
is
the
case
of

considered

In
a
more
realistic
situation,
the
electron
density
spillage
beyond
the
geometric
boundaries
over
a
small
distance
	
is
allowed
so
that
the

of
the

.
Such
a
gen-
eralization
of
the
model
was
proposed
by
Y
u
et

and
the
parameter
	
was
selected
to
obtain
the
bulklike
char
ge
den-
sity
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
lm.
If
the
distance
	
is
ener
gy
dependent,
the
model
can
be
made
equivalent
to
the
phase-accumulation
model
in
which
the
phase
of
a
wave
function
changes
as
a
result
of
reections
from
the
bound-
aries

as
introduced
by
Echenique
and
Pendry
38

.
However
,
in
the
present
paper
the
spillage
distance
	
is
taken
constant.
In
the
original
formulation
for
the
free-electron
model,
the
spillage
distance
	
was
determined
uniquely
by
the
bulk
Fermi
wave
vector
by
demanding
that
the
char
ge
density
in
the
geometric
middle
of
the
lm
equals
its
bulk
value.
Such
a
procedure
implied
that
the
Fermi
wave
vector
and
Fermi
ener
gy
for
a
thin
lm
were
unchanged
with
respect
to
the
bulk
situation.
The
key
assumption
of
local
char
ge
neutrality
in
the
middle
of
the
lm
was
criticized
by
Rogers
et
al.
39
In
our
work
the
parameter
	
is
treated
as
a
free
parameter
which
may
be
adjusted
to
best

the
experimental
data

require

On

The

method
does
not
take

the

of

due

.
In

opinion,
this

seems
justied
for
the
case
of
MgB

.
The
studies
of
Y
ildirim
et
al.
23
show
that
the
main
contribution
to
the
creation
of
the
superconducting
state
re-
sults
from
the
interaction
of
electrons
with
the
E
2
g
mode
optical
phonons
causing
in-plane
deformation
of
the
honey-
comb
B
layers.
These
modes
should
remain
unmodied
in

0001

-oriented
ultrathin
lms
since
their
displacement
vec-
tors
lie
in
this
plane.
The
possible
surface
phonon
modes
are
also
neglected.
W
e
do
not
include
the
surface
electronic
states
in
our
study
and
neglect
the
possible
modication
of
the
electron-
phonon
coupling
at
the
surface,
in
analogy
to
the
free-
electron
studies.
In
a
recent
paper
Petaccia
et

46
measured
the
electron-phonon
coupling
for
the
surface
state
in
MgB

The

hand,
the

the

the

However
,
w
e
decided
to
select
the
cutof
f
consistent
with
the
experimental
Debye

In
the
ultrathin
lm
case,
the
2D
DOS
in

equals
the
3D
DOS
due
to
negligible
dispersion
in
the
z
direction

i.e.,
the
Fermi
surface
sheet
is
almost
exactly
cylindric

.
The
critical
temperatures
for
the
ultrathin
lms
were
de-
termined
from
Eq.



,
with
the
matrix
elements
of
the
form
given
by


.
Due
to
the
existence
of
N
wave
vectors
k
z
for
the
lm
composed
of
N
boron
planes,
a
number
of
N
gaps
may
exist
for
each
band

or

.
A
s
the
DOS
in
the

band
is
independent
on
the
n
value,
an
ener
gy
gap
is
assigned
to
each
of
the
N
subbands.
In
the
case
of
the

band,
not
every
n
th
subband
crosses
the
Fermi
level
so
that
the
number
of
gap
values
is
less
than
N
.
The
calculated
critical
temperatures
are
presented
in
Fig.

.
The

of
changes
can
be
observed
with
a
substantial
decrease
of
T

for
the

The

the

be
compared
with

In
general,
the
char
ge
spillage
leads
to
a
decrease
of
critical
temperature
below
its
bulk
value

which
is
consistent
with
the
behavior
observed
experimentally
and
thus
justies
the
necessity
of
including
char
ge

in
the
model

.

It
is
worth
noticing
that
the
oscilla-
tions
with
lm

are
strongly
suppressed
when

takes
place.
Also
in
this

has
only
a
weak
ef

on
the

,
contrary
to
the
situation

Unlike
the
free-electron
model,
which
predicts
the

,
the
presented
model
does
not
give
such

related

the

which
can
be
attrib-

to
the
rather
complicated

.
Another
remark
concerning
the
comparison
of
our
results
with
the
free-electron

ones
appears
important.
In
such
studies
the
lm
thickness
is
treated
as
a
continuous

For
any
real

we
obviously
obtain
the
discrete

and
the
character
of
the

of
any

strongly
modied.

it
depends

we
may
observe
that
the

If
the
comparable
magnitude
of
oscillations
might
be
expected
for

it
would
correspond
to
a

The

explained

SUMMAR
Y
In
the
present
study
,
a
description
of
BCS
superconduc-
tivity
in
ultrathin
lms
was
suggested,
with
application
of
the
orthogonal
TBA
to
the
electron
wave
function
construction.
The
method
allows
for
the
determination
of
the
band
struc-
ture,
the
Fermi
level
shift,
and
nally
the
critical
temperature
of
the
thin
superconducting
lms
as
thickness
dependent.
W
e
take
into
account
various
boundary
conditions.
The
knowl-
edge
of
the
purely
geometric
parameters
of
the
lm
is
suf-
cient
to
relate
the
ultrathin
lm
and
the
bulk
matrix
elements
of
BCS
interaction.
The
method
was
applied
to
MgB
2
for
which
TBA
seems
to
describe
well
the
electronic
properties.
It
was
predicted
that
lms
consisting
of
less
than
four
MgB
2
layers
exhibit
a
severe
decrease
in
the
critical
tem-
perature.
For
the
char
ge
spillage
disallowed,
the
critical
tem-
perature
oscillates
sharply
with
thickness

due
to
rapid
changes
of
boundary
conditions
for
dif
ferent
compositions
of
covering
atomic
planes

and
is
raised
for
thicker
lms.
The
char
ge
spillage
makes
the
dependence
more
smooth,
damps
the
dependence
on
the
kind
of
the
covering
layers,
and
low-
ers
in
general
the
critical
temperature
below
the
bulk
value.
Such
a
behavior
is
observed
experimentally
in
studies
of
the
ultrathin
lms
of
Pb

111

see
Refs.
27
and
30

.
It
is
usual
to
describe
the
properties
of
superconductors
with
phonon
mechanism
within
the
Eliashber
g
formalism,
which
allows
for
taking
into
account
the
electron-phonon
interaction
and
phonon
DOS
in
a
more
accurate
manner
.
10
,
11
Especially
,
the
distribution
of
the
gap
parameter
within
the
distinct
Fermi
surface
sheets
was
shown.
The
precision
of
the
predictions
based
on
the
rst-principles
calculations
was
proven
experimentally
,
taking
the
investigations
of
specic
heat
of
Golubov
et
al.
51
as
an
example.
However
,
w
e
are
convinced
that
the
usage
of
the
isotropic
BCS
model
with
the
parameters
adjusted
to
t
the
bulk
parameters
of
MgB
2
al-
lows
one
to
capture
the
essentials
of
the
ultrathin
lm
ef
fects
in
an
advantageously
clear
way
and
provide
at
least
a
rough
insight
into
magnesium
diboride
lm
properties.
It
also
in-
troduces
the
realistic
band
structure
to
the
previously
studied
free-electron
models.
2
–

The
two-band
BCS
model
has
been
successfully
applied
to
the
thermodynamical
studies
of
the
bulk
magnesium
diboride
by
Mishonov
et
al.
,
52
who
repro-
duced
the
experimental
data
with
an
accuracy
of
a
few
per
-
cent.
W
e
believe
that
this
model
is
sufcient
for
the
purpose
limited
to
investigating
the
critical
temperature
and
ener
gy
gap
values.
